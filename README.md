# ESPWeatherClock
A simple weather clock using ESP8266 (D1 Mini), and ST7735 TFT Module.

I am using ESP8266-ST7735-weather-station by LacyBad and weatherClock-esp8266 by nullboundary for reference.

My additions are automatic brightness control and a buzzer for hourly beep.
A push button to set if device is running on battery or countinous supply to set bet brightness mode.

This is my first project on git so sorry in case something is wrong with documentation stuff.
